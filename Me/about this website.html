		<h1>How and why does this website exists?</h1>

        <p>As you might have read in my hobbies and interests, I'm passionate about learning new things regardless of what it is. I like to try new foods, new cultures, sports, and even new languages. This website is the "living" proof of my willigness to learn.</p>
        <p>This website was completely done by me as I'm learning html code. I'm completing an online course called "The complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" which is available in Udemy. This project is the end of HTML code, and after this I'll learn how to write in CSS to give more color to this website of mine.</p>
